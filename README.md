Hi. 

I had some dependency issues when I tried to apply some tests, but probably its just me, because I never used mocha/chai... 


I will understand if this work wouldn't be accepted, but I did what I can. 


Most of the time I spend on adding a libraries and rollbacks (this code is from 2016 I guess?). 


It was fun thought.
