Hi.
I had some dependency essyes when I tryed to apply some tests, but probobly its just me, because I never used mocha/chai...
I would understand if this work will not get accepted, but I did what I can. Most of the time I spended on adding a libraries and rollbacks (this code is from 2016 I guess?).
It was fun thought.
